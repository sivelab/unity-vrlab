Moved to Rift S
Have headset tracking good

position and rotation are from the right places

TODO: get transforms working (the camera rotation relative to the other objects is weird, for example)
TODO: need offset for table, chair pivots and probably rotations
TODO: visuals for table / chairs
TODO: track hand positions
TODO: script to create and end the task (stack blocks)
TODO: incorporate grabbing with task objects
TODO: hands (controllers) should be relative to the chair or table. THis means that there needs\
 to be an offset from the headset to that object, since theya re tracked by the headset
